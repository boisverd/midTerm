        <article class="a1">Circuits can be simple such as a switch, power source and lamp. It can also be as complex as a modern computer motherboard. Simple circuits can be designed by any technician or even hobbyists, whilst a complex circuit is often designed by teams of electrical engineers.

        <article class="a2">A solid circuit design starts by properly addressing a need. This might the control of high voltages using opto-isolators or solid-state relays. A low 12Vdc power supply can control 120Vac, 240Vac, three-phase 347Vac industrial power supplies using solid-state relays or mechanical relays. A circuit is needed to understand the need and with good reference material and training, the circuit can be constructed.</article>
        <article class="a3">Computer assisted design, also known as CAD software is used in all modern designs. One can design a circuit on paper, but CAD is best for rapid development and even simulation of the circuit. Simulation assists the circuit designer in testing the effectiveness and safety of the circuit before prototyping begins. <a href="https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/eagle/features">Eagle</a> software by Autodesk is an excellent example of CAD. <a href="https://www.orcad.com/">OrCAD</a> is another fine example of a complete design suite that contains many libraries for a myriad of designs.</article>
